**Policy Management System Application**

**Description:**

The Policy Management System Application is a Java-based software solution designed to streamline and automate the management of policies within an organization. It provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to create, update, delete, and monitor various policies, ensuring compliance and adherence to organizational guidelines.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Authentication:** The application includes a robust user authentication system to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and manage policies.

3. **Policy Categories:** Policies can be categorized based on their type, department, or any other relevant criteria. This categorization helps in easy navigation and organization.

4. **Policy Versioning:** The system maintains a version history for each policy. This allows administrators to track changes, view previous versions, and restore previous policy versions if needed.

5. **Approval Workflow:** Policies can go through an approval workflow before becoming active. This feature ensures that policies are reviewed and authorized by designated personnel before implementation.

6. **Search and Filter:** Users can search for policies using keywords, categories, or dates, making it simple to locate specific policies within the system.

7. **Notifications:** The application sends notifications to administrators for policy approvals, expirations, and other relevant events, keeping them informed and proactive.

8. **Audit Trail:** An audit trail records all actions taken on policies, providing a transparent history of who made changes and when.
